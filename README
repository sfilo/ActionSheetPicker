Easily present an ActionSheet with a PickerView, allowing user to select from a number of immutible options.
Based on the HTML drop-down alternative found in mobilesafari.

Some code derived from marcio's post on Stack Overflow [ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1262574/add-uipickerview-a-button-in-action-sheet-how ]
